## Mango Leaf Disease Detection and Severity Assessment

### Project Overview
This Final Year Project focuses on **automated detection of mango leaf diseases** and **severity assessment** using deep learning and image processing techniques.  
The system helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early and estimate severity levels for better crop management.

### Objective
Diseases of mango leaves are some of the biggest threats agri-business people and farmers have to deal with to improve yields and produce quality mangoes. The existing manual inspection 
technique is time-consuming and not very accurate, especially for small-scale farmers who may not have adequate knowledge. The solution further proposed in this work is designed to use image 
recognition and deep learning techniques to diagnose common mango leaf diseases to mitigate the continued spread of diseases, and consequently, the subsequent losses of mango crops.

### Features
- Image preprocessing (noise removal, resizing, normalization).  
- Disease classification using **CNN / YOLOv8 / CNN**.  
- Severity estimation (high, moderate, low).  
- Visualization of infected areas on mango leaves.  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)  
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNN, ResNet50, YOLOv8/YOLOv11  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Kaggle, Streamlit/Dash  
- **Dataset**: Mango leaf images (collected from orchards / Kaggle / MLDID)
